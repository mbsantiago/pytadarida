# PyTadarida

PyTadarida is a Python wrapper for the Tadarida-D algorithm, which is a method
for detecting presence of bioacoustic events in audio recordings. The algorithm
is described in detail in the following paper:

> Bas, Y., Bas, D., & Julien, J.-F. (2017). Tadarida: A Toolbox for Animal
> Detection on Acoustic Recordings. Journal of Open Research Software, 5(1), 6.
> DOI: http://doi.org/10.5334/jors.154

The original implementation of the algorithm is written in C++, and is available
on its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/YvesBas/Tadarida-D).

## Installation

PyTadarida is available on PyPI, and can be installed with pip:

    pip install pytadarida

## Usage

PyTadarida exposes a single function, `run_tadarida`, which takes a list of .wav
files or directories containing .wav files as input, and returns a pandas
DataFrame containing the detected events.

    from pytadarida import run_tadarida

    events, status = run_tadarida(["/path/to/file.wav", "/path/to/directory"])

The `status` variable is a object containing the status of the algorithm after
running. It can be used to check whether the algorithm was able to process the
file, and any warnings that were generated.

    tadarida_run_message = status.stdout
    tadarida_error_message = status.errors
    tadarida_detection_message = status.detect
